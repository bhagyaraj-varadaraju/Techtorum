## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Discussed how to build ERD and wireframes to facilate the design of database schema and the user interface of the web app.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The ERD and wireframes are not easy to build. It requires a lot of thinking and discussion to come up with a good design. We weighted the pros and cons of different designs and finally decided on one that we think is the best.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Authentication and deployment of the web app are required in upcoming units as we continue to work on our final project.
