## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We learnt about the github's project and issues feature. It was a fruitful discussion with the teammate and we were able to come up with a good plan for the final project. We also planned the baseline and custom features that we are going to implement and assigned sprints/milestones to them.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We were stuck on the CSS for the profile page. So, we utilised Tailwind CSS for implementing the CSS for the project.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We were planning to finish the landing page and profile page for this sprint. We were able to finish the profile page but not the landing page. Although we implemented the Navbar component required for the landing page. We will prioritize the feed component for the next sprint.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The features that are at risk are the follow feature and the search feature. We will change our plan by prioritizing the search feature and if time allows will move on to follow feature.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We need to understand how to implement the login feature and also the follow feature. We also need to understand how to deploy the app.
