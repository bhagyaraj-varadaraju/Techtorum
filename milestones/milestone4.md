## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Getting the website into shape and proceeding with the features that needs to implemented. The collaboration between the team members is also good.

Yes, the tasks for this week are completed. The remaining tasks are to be completed in the next week.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Following and Followers feature is at risk. If it remains at risk, we will have to remove it from the project.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We need to deploy and host our project on Railway. We need to follow the similar steps as we did in the last lecture class.
