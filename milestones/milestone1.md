## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

It was a fruitful discussion with the teammate and we were to come up with a good idea for the final project. We also planned the required and custom features that we are going to implement.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Since it was the planning phase, we didn't face any challenges. But the only thing that we were not sure about was the features that we were going to implement. We had a lot of ideas but we were not sure if we could implement them. So we had to do some research on the features that we were going to implement.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We will need support in the upcoming units as we continue to work on our final project. We will also need help with the implementation of the features and deployment of the app.
